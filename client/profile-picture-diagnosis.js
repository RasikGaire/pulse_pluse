üîç PROFILE PICTURE NOT SHOWING - DIAGNOSIS & SOLUTION

üìä ISSUE ANALYSIS:
‚úÖ Profile.jsx image display code: WORKING CORRECTLY
‚úÖ Backend API profile endpoint: WORKING CORRECTLY  
‚úÖ Database profilePicture field: EXISTS AND FUNCTIONAL
‚ùå Current user has NO profile picture uploaded

üéØ ROOT CAUSE:
The seeded users in the database have profilePicture: null
Users need to upload a profile picture using the profile verification page.

üöÄ SOLUTION STEPS:

STEP 1: UPLOAD A PROFILE PICTURE
1. Login to the application:
   - Go to: http://localhost:5173/login
   - Login with: rajesh.shrestha@gmail.com / password123

2. Navigate to Profile Edit:
   - Go to: http://localhost:5173/profile-verification
   - Or click "Edit Profile" button from profile page

3. Upload Profile Picture:
   - Click the camera icon or "Choose Photo" button
   - Select an image file (JPG, PNG, GIF, max 5MB)
   - See the preview
   - Click "Save Profile"

STEP 2: VERIFY PROFILE PICTURE DISPLAY
1. After saving, you'll be redirected to profile page
2. The uploaded image should now display
3. Image will be stored as base64 in the database

üì± HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS:

1. PROFILE DISPLAY LOGIC (Profile.jsx):
   - Checks if userData.profilePicture exists
   - If yes: displays the uploaded image
   - If no: shows default /profile.jpg
   - Added error handling for failed image loads

2. PROFILE UPLOAD LOGIC (ProfileVerification.jsx):
   - Converts selected image to base64
   - Sends to backend via updateProfile API
   - Stores in MongoDB User.profilePicture field

3. BACKEND STORAGE:
   - User model has profilePicture: String field
   - Accepts base64 image data
   - Returns profilePicture in profile API response

üîß DEBUGGING FEATURES ADDED:
‚úÖ Console logs to check profile picture data
‚úÖ Improved image fallback handling
‚úÖ Error handling for broken images
‚úÖ Better null/empty string checking

üéâ NEXT STEPS:
1. Upload a profile picture via profile-verification page
2. Check profile page - image should display
3. Verify in browser console for debugging info

üí° NOTE:
The profile picture feature is working correctly - users just need to upload images first!

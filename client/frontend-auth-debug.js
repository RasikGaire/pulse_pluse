// Frontend Authentication State Checker
console.log(`
🔍 FRONTEND AUTHENTICATION DEBUG

The "User not found" error typically means:

1. NO USER LOGGED IN:
   - User never logged in
   - LocalStorage is empty
   - Need to login first

2. TOKEN EXPIRED:
   - Token exists but expired
   - Need to login again

3. INVALID TOKEN:
   - Token corrupted
   - Wrong format

📋 STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION:

STEP 1: Clear browser storage
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Application > Storage
- Clear all localStorage data
- Or run: localStorage.clear()

STEP 2: Login properly
- Go to: http://localhost:5173/login
- Login with: rajesh.shrestha@gmail.com
- Password: password123
- Wait for redirect

STEP 3: Check authentication
- After login, check localStorage:
  localStorage.getItem('token')
  localStorage.getItem('user')
- Should see valid token and user data

STEP 4: Access profile
- Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/profile
- Should work without "User not found" error

🚨 COMMON CAUSES:

1. NOT LOGGED IN:
   Most common cause - user went directly to /profile without logging in

2. BROWSER CACHE:
   Old cached data causing issues

3. MULTIPLE TABS:
   Different authentication states in different tabs

4. DEVELOPMENT MODE:
   Hot reload clearing authentication state

🔧 QUICK FIX:
1. Clear browser data
2. Login again
3. Access profile page

The backend is working perfectly, this is a frontend authentication state issue.
